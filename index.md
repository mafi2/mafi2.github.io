### About Me
I work on computer vision problems. My interests include explainable AI, deep metric and representation learning and their interdisciplinary applications.

### Most Recent Work

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am currently working in Roche's phc department in the Data, Analytics & Imaging group. I utilize deep learning and self-supervised methods to create cutting-edge solutions for medical image analysis and various downstream tasks in digital pathology. This role combines healthcare, product development, deep learning and bio-medical image analysis, making it a challenging and rewarding place to work. Our first results on foundational models in digital pathology will be published in 2023/24 (arXiv link will follow). Learn more about the work we do at Roche's phc [here](https://www.roche.com/about/strategy/personalised-healthcare). </p>

### Projects 

Master thesis: _"Tackling Challenges and Enhancing Disease Diagnosis in Medical Imaging with Deep Metric Learning"_ supervised by [Prof. Ommer](https://ommer-lab.com) (LMU Munich) and [Prof. Hamprecht](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/ial) (University of Heidelberg)
* Proposed a novel deep metric learning approach for classifying lung diseases in X-rays using disease-conditioned similarity networks.
* Addressed challenges like image variability, class imbalance, and domain shifts.
* Outperformed or on par with state-of-the-art methods.
* Analyzed weakly-supervised and fully supervised methods, as well as different models and losses.


Bachelor thesis: _"Conditional Similarity Learning for Multilabel Classification of Medical Images"_ 
supervised by Prof. Ommer [(Machine Vision and Learning Group)](https://ommer-lab.com).
* Created new deep metric learning approach to classify thorax diseases using TensorFlow
* Made it possible to learn more about the similarity of diseases by creating a <i>disentangled</i> representation space
* Increased classification ROC AUC score by 6% over the baseline

Hackathon challenge: _"Bias Free AI"_ by IBM at Q Summit in Mannheim
* Implemented efficient algorithm in Python to solve the problem of a <i>fair</i> assignment of teachers to a school
* Used machine learning techniques such as k means clustering and k nearest neighbor classification
* Applied solution to real world data and won 2nd place

University project: _"Galaxy Detection and Classification in the Hubble Deep Field"_
* Trained CNN to classify 10 different galaxy types
* Performed classification with accuracy of 86%
* Designed end-to-end approach to detect and classify galaxies in images of the Hubble Deep Field

University project: _"Eigenfaces"_ R package
* Created R package in a team of 3 that enables simple principal component analysis for different datasets such as human faces
* Tested package and wrote extensive documentation
* Implemented interactive shiny application
