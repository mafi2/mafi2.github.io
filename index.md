### Projects 
Bachelor Thesis: _"Conditional Similarity Learning for Multilabel Classification of Medical Images"_ 
supervised by Prof. Ommer [(Machine Vision and Learning Group)](https://ommer-lab.com).
* Created new deep metric learning approach to classify thorax diseases using Tensorflow
* Made it possible to learn about the similarity of disease by creating a disentangled representation space
* Increased classification ROC AUC score by 6% over the baseline

Hackathon challenge: _"Bias Free AI"_ by IBM at Q Summit in Mannheim
* Implemented efficient algorithm in python to solve the problem of a *fair* assignment of teachers to a school
* Used machine learning techniques such as k means clustering and k nearest neighbor classification
* Won 2nd place

University project: _"Galaxy Detection and Classification in the Hubble Deep Field"_
* Trained CNN to classify 10 different galaxy types
* Performed classification with accuracy of 86%
* Designed end-to-end approach to detect and classify galaxies in images of the Hubble Deep Field

University project: _"Eigenfaces"_ R package
* Created R package in a team of 3 that enables simple principal component analysis for different dataset such as human faces
* Tested and wrote extensive documentation
* Implemented interactive shiny application
