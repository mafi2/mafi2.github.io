#### Conditional Similarity Learning for Multilabel Classification of Medical Images
Bachelor Thesis supervised by Prof. Ommer at Heidelberg University (Jan. - Jul. 2021)

The work on this project has been continued afterwards as a student assistant. The classification performance has been
further improvement and new techniques have been applied such as proxy anchor loss. The results are planned to be 
published in the beginning of 2023.

Most important papers that have been used or reimplemented for the bachelor thesis:
* X. Wang, X. Han, W. Huang, D. Dong, and M.R. Scott. *Multi-Similarity Loss with General
